# Face, Eyes, and Smile Detection in Images

This Python script uses OpenCV to detect faces, eyes, and smiles in an image.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

1. Python 3 installed on your system.
2. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) installed. You can install it using pip:

   ```shell
   pip install opencv-python
**Usage**
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/saramh22222/Face-Detection.git)https://github.com/saramh22222/Face-Detection.git
Place your image in the same directory as the script. Ensure the image file path is correctly specified in the code (e.g., "oar2.jpg").

Replace the haarcascade XML files with the appropriate cascade classifier XML files for face, eyes, and smile detection. You can download them from the OpenCV GitHub repository or other reliable sources.
